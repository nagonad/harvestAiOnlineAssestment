This project is a simple web application that allows users to view two different charts - a Bar Chart and a Weather Forecast Chart. The Bar Chart is designed using HTML and CSS, showcasing the developer's skills. The Weather Forecast Chart utilizes the Highcharts package, and a custom hook fetches data for a seamless user experience. To simplify the setup, the API key is hardcoded, eliminating the need for users to provide their own.

```node
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using the following command:

npm run dev
Once the application is running, navigate to the home page. You will find two buttons, one for the Bar Chart and another for the Weather Forecast Chart.

Click the "Bar Chart" button to view the custom-designed Bar Chart. Please note that while the chart may not be pixel-perfect, it serves as a demonstration of the developer's skills.

Weather Forecast Chart
Click the "Weather Forecast Chart" button to view the Weather Forecast Chart. The chart utilizes the Highcharts package, and the data is fetched using a custom hook. The API key is hardcoded for a better user experience, eliminating the need for users to provide their own API key.
